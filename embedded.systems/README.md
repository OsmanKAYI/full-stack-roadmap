# Embedded Systems

Embedded systems are specialized computing systems that are dedicated to performing specific functions within a larger mechanical or electrical system. These systems are designed to be compact, efficient, and reliable, and they find applications in a wide range of fields, from consumer electronics to industrial automation.

## Getting Started

If you are interested in developing for embedded systems, consider the following steps:

**Learn a Programming Language:** C and C++ are commonly used for embedded systems due to their low-level capabilities.
**Understand Electronics:** Basic knowledge of electronics, including microcontrollers and sensors, is essential.
**Select Hardware:** Choose a microcontroller or processor that suits your project requirements.
**Development Environment:** Set up an integrated development environment (IDE) tailored for embedded systems.
**Start Coding:** Write and test your code, considering memory constraints and real-time requirements.

## Development Tools

**IDEs:** Keil ÂµVision, Eclipse, MPLAB X IDE.
**Simulators:** Proteus, QEMU.
**Hardware Platforms:** Arduino, Raspberry Pi, STM32 Discovery boards.
