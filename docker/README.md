# DOCKER

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications using containerization technology. Docker containers are lightweight, portable, and self-contained, making them ideal for deploying applications in a variety of environments.

## Getting Started

To get started with Docker, you can follow these steps:

- Download and install Docker from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/).
- Build a Docker image using a Dockerfile that describes your application environment and dependencies.
- Run a Docker container using the Docker image you just built.
- Test your application to ensure that it is working correctly in the Docker container.

## Documentation

The Docker documentation is available online at [docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/). This documentation includes guides, tutorials, and reference material for learning Docker and using it effectively. And you can also follow the links below.
