# An Ideal Roadmap for Beginners

## Learning Methodology: Prioritize Coding, Then Theory

The path in machine learning (ML) has been quite unique. A project-centric approach has been embraced, emphasizing hands-on experience over theoretical knowledge. This "code-first, theory-later" strategy has allowed for effective grasping of ML through practical applications.

Learning thrives on necessity; when confronted with challenges, resources are sought, understood, and actions are taken. This "learn as you go" philosophy maintains alignment with practical applications and career aspirations.

## Projects Create Opportunities

Every internship secured has stemmed from developed projects, highlighting the significance of applying knowledge. This project-first mindset is essential for transitioning from theoretical understanding to real-world applications.

**Containerization**:

- **Docker and Kubernetes**: For streamlined deployment processes.

## Clarifying Goals: ML Engineers vs. ML Researchers

Understanding career objectives is essential. For those aspiring to be ML engineers, concentrating on application rather than theoretical concepts is key. This clarity enables focus on skills that directly influence career trajectories.

## Deep Learning: When to Explore Further

Once comfortable with ML fundamentals, delving into deep learning can be beneficial. Starting with applied ML establishes a solid foundation, allowing for a transition to deep learning as projects demand it. As more complex tasks are tackled, the desire to explore deep learning naturally arises.

### 1. Start with Basic Neural Networks

Beginning with the construction of simple neural networks aids in understanding layers and neurons. A fun introductory project involves building a digit classifier using the MNIST dataset.

**Explore CNNs and RNNs**:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Ideal for image tasks, CNNs excel at recognizing patterns in images. Classifying animal images can demonstrate how CNNs identify features.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Suitable for sequence data, RNNs are effective for tasks like text generation or sentiment analysis. A simple chatbot can illustrate how RNNs understand context.
