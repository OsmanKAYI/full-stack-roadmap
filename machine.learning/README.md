# MACHINE LEARNING

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing systems that can learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning

- Classification
- Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests

### 2. Unsupervised Learning

- Clustering
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Anomaly Detection
- Association Rule Learning
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### 3. Reinforcement Learning

- Q-Learning
- Deep Q Networks
- Policy Gradient Methods
- Actor-Critic Methods
- Monte Carlo Methods
