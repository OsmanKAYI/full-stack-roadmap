# ALGORITHMS

Algorithms are a set of instructions designed to perform a specific task. They are used in a variety of fields, including computer science, mathematics, and engineering, to solve problems and improve efficiency.

## Getting Started

To get started with algorithms, you can follow these steps:

1. Learn the basics of algorithm design by reading books or taking online courses. Some popular resources include "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein and "Algorithm Design Manual" by Steven Skiena.
2. Implement algorithms in your preferred programming language. Practice implementing sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Quick Sort.
3. Analyze the time complexity and space complexity of your algorithms. Understanding these concepts will help you design more efficient algorithms.

## Common Algorithms

There are many algorithms that are commonly used in computer science, including:

- Sorting algorithms: `Bubble Sort`, `Selection Sort`, `Insertion Sort`, `Merge Sort`, `Quick Sort`.
- Search algorithms: `Linear Search`, `Binary Search`.
- Graph algorithms: `Breadth-First Search (BFS)`, `Depth-First Search (DFS)`, `Dijkstra's Algorithm`, `A* Search Algorithm`.
- Dynamic programming algorithms: `Fibonacci Sequence`, `Knapsack Problem`, `Longest Common Subsequence`.
