# IP

An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique identifier for devices connected to a network. It is used to identify the device and to communicate with other devices on the network.
IP Versions

There are two versions of IP addresses in use today: IPv4 and IPv6.

## IPv4

IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers represented in dotted-decimal notation (e.g. 192.168.0.1). They are the most commonly used IP addresses today, but the number of available addresses is limited.

## IPv6

IPv6 addresses are 128-bit numbers represented in hexadecimal notation (e.g. 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). They provide a much larger number of available addresses, but adoption has been slow due to the need for infrastructure changes.
