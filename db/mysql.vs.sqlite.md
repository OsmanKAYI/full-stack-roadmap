# SQLite vs. MySQL: Key Differences

Both SQLite and MySQL are popular relational database management systems (RDBMS), but they differ in architecture, use cases, performance, and security. Hereâ€™s a concise breakdown of their differences:

---

## **TL;DR**

- **SQLite:** Lightweight, serverless, single-file database, ideal for mobile apps, small websites, and prototyping.
- **MySQL:** Client-server model, highly scalable and secure, suited for enterprise apps, high-traffic websites, and e-commerce.

## **Comparison Overview**

| **Feature**      | **SQLite**                                              | **MySQL**                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Architecture** | Serverless; database stored in a single file.           | Client-server; requires a running server for handling queries. |
| **Data Types**   | Flexible, dynamic types with minimal constraints.       | Strict data types ensuring better data integrity.              |
| **Concurrency**  | Single-writer, file-level locking.                      | High concurrency with row-level locking.                       |
| **Performance**  | Best for read-heavy, small to medium applications.      | Scales for large, high-traffic, and write-intensive systems.   |
| **Security**     | Relies on filesystem permissions for access.            | User authentication, encryption, and access control.           |
| **Use Cases**    | Mobile apps, embedded systems, testing, and prototypes. | Enterprise apps, e-commerce, data warehousing, analytics.      |
| **Licensing**    | Public domain (completely free).                        | Free (GPL) with commercial licensing options via Oracle.       |

## **Detailed Comparison**

### **Architecture**

- **SQLite:**
  - Serverless; embedded into the application.
  - Entire database stored in a single, portable file.
  - Ideal for simplicity and easy setup.
- **MySQL:**
  - Client-server model with server handling database operations.
  - Requires server setup, suitable for remote and distributed systems.

### **Data Types**

- **SQLite:**
  - Limited types (`integer`, `real`, `text`, `blob`) with flexible storage.
  - Type affinities allow storing any data type in any column.
  - May lead to data integrity issues if unchecked.
- **MySQL:**
  - Rich, strict data types (`integer`, `varchar`, `datetime`, etc.).
  - Ensures strict enforcement of column data integrity.

### **Concurrency**

- **SQLite:**
  - Single writer allowed; file-level locking during write operations.
  - Supports multiple simultaneous reads.
- **MySQL:**
  - Multi-threaded with high concurrency.
  - Uses row-level locking for better performance in concurrent environments.

### **Performance and Scalability**

- **SQLite:**
  - Optimized for small, read-intensive workloads.
  - Can handle databases up to ~281 TB but slows significantly with heavy writes.
- **MySQL:**
  - Designed for large-scale applications with high traffic.
  - Features like clustering, sharding, and partitioning support scalability.

### **Security**

- **SQLite:**
  - Relies on file access permissions for security.
  - Suitable for single-user or embedded environments.
- **MySQL:**
  - Advanced security features like user authentication, role-based access, and SSL/TLS.
  - Allows fine-grained control over database access and encryption.

### **Use Cases**

- **SQLite:**
  - Prototyping, mobile apps, small websites, desktop apps.
  - Embedded systems with lightweight storage needs.
- **MySQL:**
  - Large-scale enterprise applications, e-commerce platforms, and analytics.
  - High-traffic websites with complex queries and heavy write operations.

## **When to Choose**

- **SQLite:**

  - For lightweight, embedded applications.
  - When simplicity and portability are key.
  - If setup time and maintenance need to be minimal.

- **MySQL:**
  - For enterprise-grade, scalable systems.
  - When security and concurrency are priorities.
  - For handling complex, high-volume workloads.

Both databases excel in their respective domains; understanding project requirements will help you make the right choice.
