# Importance of API Key Security

> TLDR: An API key is a unique authentication key used by applications to access specific services, such as maps or weather data. Proper handling of API keys is crucial for maintaining service security.

## Understanding API Keys

In development processes, an API key is essential for allowing an application to access certain services. It serves as a unique identifier for authentication purposes and is vital for ensuring the security of the service.

## Risks of Exposing API Keys

Leaving an API key exposed in the code, such as storing it in plain text, can lead to several issues:

1. **Security Breach**: Malicious individuals can access the key and exploit the permissions granted to the application.
2. **Service Abuse**: Those who obtain the key may consume service quotas or limits, leading to potential service disruption.
3. **Data Loss**: If the key provides access to sensitive data, such as a database, it can result in data breaches.
4. **Increased Costs**: Abuse of the key can lead to unexpectedly high billing due to excessive usage.

## Recommended Solutions

To mitigate these risks, consider the following practices:

- Store API keys in `.env` files to keep them secure.
- Utilize secure storage solutions (e.g., SecureStore, Keychain) for sensitive information.
- Never leave API keys exposed in the codebase.
