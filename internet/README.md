# INTERNET

The internet is a global network of interconnected devices and computers that allows for the transfer of data and communication between users around the world. The web is a subset of the internet that refers to the collection of websites and web pages that can be accessed through a web browser.

## How Web Works

The web is built on a set of technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that work together to create and display web pages. Web pages are stored on web servers and can be accessed by users through a web browser. Websites can be created using a variety of tools and frameworks, and can be hosted on a variety of platforms.

**REMEMBER:** Every problem is a DNS problem until it is resolved.

- When solving problems, look for the simplest answer. To do this, we must know how systems work. To get started, you can start from there by knowing that DNS addresses have IP equivalents.

## Web Development

Web development refers to the process of creating websites and web applications. This can include front-end development, which involves designing and building the user interface, as well as back-end development, which involves building and maintaining the server-side components that power a website or application.

## Web Security

Web security refers to protecting networks and computer systems from damage to or the theft of software, hardware, or data. It also includes protecting computer systems from misdirecting or disrupting the services they are designed to provide.
