# What is R57 and C99?

R57 and C99 are both hacking tools that have been used by cybercriminals in the past.

R57 is a type of remote access Trojan (RAT) and a backdoor program that allows hackers to control a compromised computer remotely. The R57 RAT is considered a serious threat to computer security and is typically detected and removed by antivirus software. It was first discovered in 2004 and has been used in several high-profile attacks, including the hack of the Democratic National Committee in 2016.

On the other hand, C99 is a webshell, which is a script that hackers can upload to a compromised web server to gain remote access and control over it. The C99 webshell was first discovered in 2005 and has been used in various attacks since then.

Both C99 and R57 are illegal tools that can cause significant damage to computer systems and networks. It is important to ensure that your computer and network security is up-to-date to prevent unauthorized access by hackers. Additionally, it is essential to avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading unknown files from the internet, as they can contain malware that can compromise your system.

In summary, while it may be tempting to explore the world of hacking, it is crucial to remember that these actions can have severe legal consequences. Instead, it is better to focus on learning ethical hacking practices, which involve testing computer systems and networks for vulnerabilities with the owner's permission.
