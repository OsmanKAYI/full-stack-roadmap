# Wireshark

Wireshark is a popular software tool known as a network analysis and packet capturing tool.

Wireshark, widely used by professional network administrators and security experts, is recognized as an effective tool for monitoring, analyzing, and detecting issues within network traffic. In this article, we will provide a more detailed explanation of what Wireshark is and its role in network security.

## What is Wireshark?

Wireshark is an open-source network protocol analysis software. It was developed as a continuation of a project called Ethereal, which was first released in 1998. Wireshark is available for various operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux. This software can capture and analyze network traffic and examine packets across various protocols.

## The Role of Wireshark in Network Security

Wireshark plays an important role in network security. Here are some of its uses in network security:

**a. Monitoring and Analyzing Network Traffic:** Wireshark allows you to capture and monitor network traffic in real-time. This enables you to detect any abnormalities or suspicious activities within the network. By analyzing network traffic, you can identify communication errors, delays, or packet loss between devices on the network.

**b. Detection of Security Breaches:** Wireshark is an effective tool for detecting security breaches within a network. By analyzing the content of captured packets in network traffic, you can identify suspicious or malicious activities. For example, you can detect encrypted data sent by attackers or phishing attacks.

**c. Improvement of Network Security:** Wireshark provides valuable information to improve network security. By examining analyzed traffic, you can identify weak encryption algorithms, open network protocols, or security vulnerabilities. Using this information, you can close security gaps in your network and establish a more secure network infrastructure.

**Using Wireshark:** While Wireshark requires some technical skills to use, it features a user-friendly interface. By using Wireshark, you can capture network traffic, select the appropriate network interface, and filter packets. Then, you can analyze the captured packets and obtain various statistics. Wireshark also supports features such as filters, coloring, and audible alerts to facilitate the analysis process.

Here are the steps to use Wireshark:

- **Download and Install Wireshark**: Download Wireshark from the official website and choose the version that matches your operating system. Once the download is complete, follow the installation wizard to install Wireshark on your computer. On Ubuntu, you can install it with the following code.

```bash
sudo apt install wireshark
# click on "YES" in the opening window
```

- **Select the Network Interface**: When you launch Wireshark, a window will appear listing available network interfaces. Choose the network interface you want to monitor. For example, if you are using a wireless network connection, select the relevant wireless network interface.
- **Start Capturing Network Traffic**: After launching Wireshark, select the "Start" option from the "Capture" menu. This indicates that Wireshark will start capturing network traffic from the selected network interface.
- **Filter Relevant Traffic (Optional)**: If you only want to monitor specific network traffic, you can use the "Capture Filter" or "Display Filter" options. These filters allow you to display only the desired traffic, such as specific protocols or IP addresses.
- **Analyze Captured Traffic**: Wireshark will open a window listing the captured packets when network traffic is captured. You can sort captured packets based on characteristics such as source IP address, destination IP address, or protocol type. Select the packets of interest and use options like "Follow" or "Decode As" to examine the content of the packets.
- **Obtain Statistics and Analysis**: Wireshark provides various statistics and analysis options about network traffic. Explore different statistical and analysis options from the "Statistics" menu. For example, the "Conversations" tab presents a summary of traffic between source and destination IP addresses.

Wireshark is an indispensable tool for network security experts and network administrators. It can be used to monitor, analyze, and detect security breaches within network traffic. Proper use of Wireshark is an important step in enhancing the security of your network and detecting potential threats. However, it is crucial to ensure that Wireshark is installed correctly and appropriate security measures are taken before using the software.
