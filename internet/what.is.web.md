# Internet Protocol

- Internet Protocol is based on giving a number, `IP Number` to each computer on the Internet. All possible IP numbers are broken down by country and service providers. Each service provider (eg TTNET) assigns an IP number to its users who access the internet. Communication between two computers connected to the Internet is abstracted as communication between two IP numbers.

## Firewall

- What we often hear called `Firewall` is actually a security system that examines the requests coming to our IP and rejects some of them.
