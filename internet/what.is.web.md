# World Wide Web (WWW or Simply the Web)

The **World Wide Web** is an information system that enables content sharing over the Internet through user-friendly ways meant to appeal to users beyond IT specialists and hobbyists. It allows documents and other web resources to be accessed over the Internet according to specific rules of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

The original and still very common document type is a web page formatted in **Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)**. This markup language supports plain text, images, embedded video and audio contents, and scripts (short programs) that implement complex user interaction. The HTML language also supports hyperlinks (embedded URLs) which provide immediate access to other web resources. Web navigation, or web surfing, is the common practice of following such hyperlinks across multiple websites. Web applications are web pages that function as application software. The information in the Web is transferred across the Internet using HTTP. Multiple web resources with a common theme and usually a common domain name make up a website. A single web server may provide multiple websites, while some websites, especially the most popular ones, may be provided by multiple servers.

## Internet Protocol

- Internet Protocol is based on giving a number, `IP Number` to each computer on the Internet. All possible IP numbers are broken down by country and service providers. Each service provider (eg TTNET) assigns an IP number to its users who access the internet. Communication between two computers connected to the Internet is abstracted as communication between two IP numbers.

## Firewall

- What we often hear called `Firewall` is actually a security system that examines the requests coming to our IP and rejects some of them.
