# Database Monitoring

Database Monitoring is a process that involves tracking and analyzing the performance, availability, and health of a database system. It helps administrators and developers identify issues, optimize performance, and ensure the reliability of the database.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a comprehensive database monitoring solution that allows users to:

- Monitor the performance metrics of their database system in real-time.
- Receive alerts and notifications when predefined thresholds are breached.
- Analyze historical data and generate reports for performance analysis.
- Identify and troubleshoot bottlenecks or performance issues.
- Ensure the availability and uptime of the database system.

## Features

- Real-time Monitoring: Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as CPU usage, memory utilization, disk I/O, query latency, and connection count in real-time.
- Alerts and Notifications: Set up customizable alerts and notifications to be notified when specific metrics exceed defined thresholds.
- Historical Data Analysis: Store and analyze historical performance data to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies.
- Dashboard and Visualization: Present performance metrics in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand dashboard with charts, graphs, and tables.
- Query Analysis: Analyze slow-performing queries, identify bottlenecks, and optimize query execution plans for improved performance.
- Scalability: Handle monitoring for large-scale database environments with support for distributed architectures and high availability.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Database Monitoring project, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies and libraries as mentioned in the [installation guide](https://github.com/OsmanKAYI/osmankayi.com/blob/43195437d2ab7a5d06a99f3d2eabed2235a23854/linux/setup.necessary.features.on.linux.24.04.md#L396).
2. [Configure the connection details and credentials](https://github.com/OsmanKAYI/osmankayi.com/blob/43195437d2ab7a5d06a99f3d2eabed2235a23854/linux/setup.necessary.features.on.linux.24.04.md#L413) for the database systems you want to monitor.
3. Customize the monitoring thresholds, alerts, and notifications based on your requirements.
4. Start the monitoring process and access the dashboard to view real-time metrics and historical data.
