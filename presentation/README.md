# Presentation Tools

Presentation tools are software applications designed to create and deliver visual presentations. They allow users to create slideshows, incorporate multimedia elements, and present information in an engaging and organized manner.

There are several popular presentation tools available that cater to different needs and preferences. Some notable presentation tools discussed here include:

- [Slidev](./slidev/) which is a web-based slides maker and presenter. It is absolutely my favourite one.

- [Reveal.js](./reveal.js/) which is an open source HTML presentation framework.
