# Python

Python is a versatile and powerful programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in various domains, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing.

## Getting Started

To get started with Python, you can follow these steps:

```BASH
sudo apt install python3
```

- Set up your development environment. You can use a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or Jupyter Notebook.
- Write your Python code using the .py file extension.
- Run your Python code using the command `python $filename.py` in the terminal or through your chosen IDE.

## Documentation

The official Python documentation is an excellent resource for learning the language and exploring its features. It can be found at [docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org/). The documentation includes tutorials, guides, and a comprehensive library reference.

## Package Management

Python has a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries and packages that extend its functionality. The most popular package manager for Python is pip. You can use pip to install, manage, and update packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI).

To install a package using pip, you can use the command `pip install $package_name`.

  - pandas is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language.
  - [Pandas Cheatsheet](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/doc/cheatsheet/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf) is a cheatsheet for creating, cleaning, reshaping, summarizing, selecting, combining, grouping, windowing, plotting, and querying.
