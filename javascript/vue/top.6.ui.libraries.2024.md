# Top 6 Vue.js UI Libraries (Vue 3) Trending in 2024

_Edit: Previously I wrote about the ‚Äú[6 Most Popular Vue.js UI Libraries (Vue 3) in 2023](https://medium.com/@ansonch/Ô∏è6-most-popular-vue-js-ui-libraries-vue-3-in-2023-aade71b00d03)‚Äù. As we are now in 2024, I have revisited the different libraries and updated them for the current year üéâ_

Vue.js, a JavaScript framework, has been gaining a lot of attention in recent years due to its simplicity, flexibility, and performance. User Interface (UI) component libraries have become an essential aspect of web development, providing a fast and convenient way to build beautiful and responsive user interfaces.

Vue 3 has become the default choice to build modern applications since Vue 2 reaching its end of life on December 31, 2023. The need for UI component libraries designed specifically for Vue 3 has risen. In this article, we will take a look at the six most popular Vue.js UI component libraries for 2024, categorized based on their popularity within English and Chinese-speaking communities.

I decided to categorize this way because of the massive popularity of Vue.js in China according to [an interview](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/between-the-wires-an-interview-with-vue-js-creator-evan-you-e383cbf57cc4/) with Evan You, the creator of Vue.js, who was born in China and grew up in a city near Shanghai.

Moreover, Vue has well-written documents in Chinese. As teams from big companies in China such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu started using Vue.js, all these factors may have contributed to its popularity in the country.
