# What is Quasar? - Quasar Framework and Vue.js

Quasar is a Vue-based framework for web, desktop, mobile (cross-platform), and all-in-one framework. You might wonder if you need to use all of these platforms when building an application, but worry not. You only need to add the platform-specific code to your program as needed.

You can read the story of the creator of this framework, Razvan Stoenescu, on [Medium](https://medium.com/quasar-framework/quasar-1-0-4bc696d60c1b).

Let's underline that there is no need for software controls like Babel, webpack, eslint. Additionally, the need for different libraries like Bootstrap, Hammerjs, etc., is also eliminated.

Those familiar with Vue know what a component is - reusable HTML blocks. Quasar consists of quite comprehensive components as well. It includes options ranging from input, button, toolbars to calendar, video players, chat box, and more.

Furthermore, if we list other reasons to choose Quasar:

- Material Design
- Highly informative documentation covering every detail
- 40+ language options
- Quasar CLI
- A very helpful Quasar community.

### Android & iOS Development

Quasar prefers to use Cordova for mobile applications. In short, Cordova allows you to develop mobile applications in a hybrid way using JavaScript. Hybrid applications, which are increasingly popular, are neither purely web-based nor purely mobile-based; we can say they are a combination of both.

## Desktop Applications

For desktop applications, we encounter another JavaScript framework called Electron. With Electron, you can develop software regardless of the operating system. Suppose you've developed a desktop application with Quasar. In that case, the framework converts it into Electron code, and of course, you can make changes to the code.

## How to Use?

By installing the CLI with:

```bash
npm install -g @quasar/cli
```

- Right after, you can get acquainted with this framework by typing the create command followed by the application name in the command line.

```bash
quasar create <folder_name>
```

Then you can proceed to the development stage with hot-reload feature by running:

```bash
quasar dev
```
