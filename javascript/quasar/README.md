  - Quasar Framework is an open-source Vue JS framework for building apps, with a single codebase, and deploy it on to Mobile, Web, or Desktop. This app is using the Quasar Framework with the Vue 3 composition API to create a note-taking app. This app will allow users to create, update and delete notes using a rich text editor that comes preconfigured with quasar. I'll also show you how you can run the app on the web, desktop, and mobile app.
