# Quasar as the UI Library for Vue3

## Why Quasar?

1. **Full Vue 3 Support**
   - Quasar 2 is fully compatible with Vue 3.
2. **Extensive Component Library**
   - Quasar offers nearly twice as many components as Vuetify 3.
3. **Multi-Platform Development**
   - Single code base for Desktop, Mobile apps, PWAs, and browser extensions.
   - Unique in its multi-platform support, rivaled only by Ionic (which lacks Desktop application support and Vue focus).
4. **Vue-Centric**
   - Quasar maintains a strong focus on Vue, unlike React which has shifted towards SSR frameworks.
5. **Active Development**
   - Quasar is continuously updated and has a solid reputation within the community.

## Getting Started with Quasar

To start using Quasar, follow these two simple steps:

```bash
