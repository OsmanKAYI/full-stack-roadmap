# System Graphical User Interface (GUI) Error and Solutions

It seems that during the package removal process, a critical system component might have been damaged. As a result, the graphical user interface (GUI) might have broken, and you are left with access only to the terminal.

To restore the GUI and fix missing packages, follow the steps below:

---

## 1. **Update System and Fix Missing Packages**

Run the following commands in the terminal to try and repair any missing or broken packages:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -f
sudo dpkg --configure -a
```

If the system is operational, these commands may restore missing dependencies.

## 2. **Reinstall GNOME or Desktop Environment**

If the GUI is completely removed, you may need to reinstall the desktop environment. For Ubuntu, to reinstall the GNOME desktop environment, use:

```bash
sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop
```

---

## 3. **Restart Graphical Session**

If the graphical session is broken, try restarting the display manager (e.g., `gdm` or `lightdm`):

```bash
sudo systemctl restart gdm
```

or

```bash
sudo systemctl restart lightdm
```

This will attempt to restart the graphical login and desktop environment.
