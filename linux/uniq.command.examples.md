# Uniq Command Examples

In Linux, we can use the uniq command that comes in handy when we want to list or remove duplicate lines that present adjacently. Apart from this, we can also use the uniq command to count duplicate entries. It is important to note that, the uniq command works only when duplicate entries are adjacent.

```bash
uniq [OPTIONS] [INPUT] [OUTPUT]
```

All the options and parameters of the uniq command are optional.
