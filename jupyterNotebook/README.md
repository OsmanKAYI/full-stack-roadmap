# Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is used for data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

## Getting Started

To get started with Jupyter Notebook, you can follow these steps:

- Download and install Anaconda from [anaconda.com/products/individual](https://www.anaconda.com/download).
- Launch Jupyter Notebook from the Anaconda Navigator or by running the `jupyter notebook` command in your terminal.
- Create a new notebook by clicking the `New` button in the upper-right corner and selecting `Notebook: Python 3`.
- Write code in the code cells and run it using the `Run` button or by pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> .
- Save your notebook and share it with others by exporting it as an HTML or PDF file. To save as PDF file follow the steps explained [here](../linux/01.setup.necessary.features.on.linux.md#convert-output-to-pdf)

## Documentation

The Jupyter Notebook documentation is available online at [jupyter-notebook.readthedocs](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). This documentation includes guides, tutorials, and reference material for learning how to use Jupyter Notebook effectively.

## Extensions

Jupyter Notebook has a wide range of extensions that can be used to enhance its functionality. These extensions can be found on [jupyter-contrib-nbextensions](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html), which is the official extension repository for Jupyter Notebook.
