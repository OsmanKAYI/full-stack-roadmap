# Business Logic

**Business logic** refers to the set of rules, algorithms, and processes that define the operations, workflows, and decision-making processes within a software application or system. It encapsulates the specific business rules, policies, and procedures that determine how data is processed, how actions are performed, and how different components of a system interact to achieve the goals of a business or organization.

In a software application, the business logic is responsible for implementing and enforcing the business rules that govern the behavior of the application. It is distinct from the user interface (UI) and the data storage layers, focusing on the underlying functionality and processing rules that drive the application's core features.

- Key aspects of business logic include:

1. **Data Validation:** Checking and validating data to ensure it meets specified criteria and business rules.

2. **Workflow Management:** Defining the sequence of steps or processes that need to be followed to accomplish a particular task or transaction.

3. **Decision Making:** Implementing rules and conditions that determine the outcomes of specific actions based on the input data.

4. **Calculations and Computations:** Performing mathematical or logical operations to derive results or make decisions.

5. **Integration:** Handling the interaction and communication between different components or systems to achieve specific business objectives.

Business logic is a critical part of software development, and its effective implementation ensures that the software aligns with the goals and requirements of the business or organization it serves. Separating business logic from other concerns, such as presentation and data storage, contributes to the maintainability, flexibility, and scalability of software applications.
