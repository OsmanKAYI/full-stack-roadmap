# How to Use Uncensored AI on Your Local Machine

1. Install the LM Studio application on your computer from [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai).
2. Search for "dolphin-2.2.1-mistral-7B-GGUF". When selecting other models, try to find the one with "GGUF" in its name. Download the Q4 version, which is the most downloaded.
3. Click on the speech bubble icon in the third menu from the left. Then, select the model you downloaded at the top. Next, choose "ChatML" on the right.
4. If you find that it generates responses that are too imaginative, on the right side, there is "Output Randomness (temp)". You can adjust it closer to 0. Similarly, you can adjust "top_p" and "top_k" as you wish to make it respond in the desired way.
