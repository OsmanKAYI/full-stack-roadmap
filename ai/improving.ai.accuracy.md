# Improving Accuracy in AI Responses

**TLDR:** To tackle misinformation from AI tools, it's crucial to use effective prompt techniques, evaluate outputs, and iterate. Here's a guide to refining AI interactions.

## Key Strategies

- **Clarify Roles**: Define who is writing the text, the purpose, and the target audience.
- **Provide Context**: Attach a PDF document to set clear boundaries.
- **Request References**: Ask for a list of sources to back up the information provided.
- **Fact Checklist**: Request a checklist to verify facts.
- **Encourage Honesty**: Specify that if the AI doesn't know something, it should admit it.

## Columbia University's 4-Step Method

Columbia University developed a structured approach to prompt engineering, consisting of:

1. **Set a Goal**: Define the objective of the AI interaction.
2. **Design a Prompt**: Create a prompt that guides the AI effectively.
3. **Evaluate**: Assess the AI’s response for accuracy and relevance.
4. **Iterate**: Refine the prompt and repeat the process for better results.

## Prompt Design Techniques

Here are some recommended techniques for designing effective prompts:

- **Reverse Interaction**: Start with the desired output and work backward to design the prompt.
- **Question Improvement**: Refine the questions to get more precise answers.
- **Real Checklist**: Use a checklist to ensure the AI addresses all key points.
