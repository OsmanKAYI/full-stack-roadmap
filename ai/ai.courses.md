It also covers Google tools to help you develop your own Gen AI apps. This course is estimated to take approximately 45 minutes to complete.

- [Introduction to Responsible AI](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/554)

  - This is an introductory-level microlearning course aimed at explaining what responsible AI is, why it's important, and how Google implements responsible AI in their products. It also introduces Google's 7 AI principles.

- [Encoder-Decoder Architecture](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/543)

  - This course gives you a synopsis of the encoder-decoder architecture, which is a powerful and prevalent machine learning architecture for sequence-to-sequence tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and question answering. You learn about the main components of the encoder-decoder architecture and how to train and serve these models. In the corresponding lab walkthrough, youâ€™ll code in TensorFlow a simple implementation of the encoder-decoder architecture for poetry generation from the beginning.

- [Attention Mechanism](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/537)

  - This course will introduce you to the attention mechanism, a powerful technique that allows neural networks to focus on specific parts of an input sequence. You will learn how attention works, and how it can be used to improve the performance of a variety of machine learning tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and question answering. This course is estimated to take approximately 45 minutes to complete.

- [Transformer Models and BERT Model](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/538)

  - This course introduces you to the Transformer architecture and the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model. You learn about the main components of the Transformer architecture, such as the self-attention mechanism, and how it is used to build the BERT model. You also learn about the different tasks that BERT can be used for, such as text classification, question answering, and natural language inference. This course is estimated to take approximately 45 minutes to complete.

- [Create Image Captioning Models](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/542)

  - This course teaches you how to create an image captioning model by using deep learning. You learn about the different components of an image captioning model, such as the encoder and decoder, and how to train and evaluate your model. By the end of this course, you will be able to create your own image captioning models and use them to generate captions for images.

- [Introduction to Generative AI Studio](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/552)
  - This course introduces Generative AI Studio, a product on Vertex AI, that helps you prototype and customize generative AI models so you can use their capabilities in your applications. In this course, you learn what Generative AI Studio is, its features and options, and how to use it by walking through demos of the product. In the end, you will have a quiz to test your knowledge.
