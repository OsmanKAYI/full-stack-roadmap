What is Leonardo AI?
At Leonardo we‚Äôre building an entire content production suite, rolling up several disparate generative AI technologies into one production-ready platform. Many of these are currently the sole realm of enthusiasts and do not fit neatly into production pipelines; we‚Äôre here to change that, and will progressively build out optimised collaborative workflows & processes to slot into existing production pipelines.

Who owns the content generated using Leonardo AI?
As per Section 3a of our terms of service, you own all input provided to the services. Additionally, Leonardo.AI assigns to you all its right, title, and interest in and to output generated and returned by the services based on your input. Therefore, as a user of the Leonardo AI platform, you own all the content you generate using the platform.

Can I use the images generated by the platform for commercial purposes?
Yes, you can use the images generated by the platform for commercial purposes. This applies to images created by free users too.

Can I control who can see my generated images?
Yes, you can control who can see your generated images by toggling them to public or private. If you toggle your images to public, they will be visible to other users and may be used by Leonardo.AI for advertising or improvement purposes. If you toggle them to private, they will not be visible to other users or Leonardo.AI, and they will not be subject to use by Leonardo.AI for advertising or improvement purposes.

Can I delete my generated images or models?
Yes, you can delete your generated images or models. However, if you have trained a public model that is popular, it may be promoted to permanent status on the website, which means the promoted model will no longer count towards your Model Allowance and cannot be deleted by you. To avoid this, you can keep your models private.

Will my content be kept private or can it be used by Leonardo.AI or other users?
As per Section 3b of our terms of service, any images that are not toggled to private (or for the duration that they are set to public), grant Leonardo.AI the right to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, create derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute text prompts and images you input into the services, or any assets produced by the service at your direction. This license also allows Leonardo.AI to make the assets available to the public and use them in order to provide, maintain, promote, and improve the services. However, if you toggle your images to private, they will not be visible to other users or Leonardo.AI, and they will not be subject to use by Leonardo.AI for advertising or improvement purposes.

A Guide to Leonardo's AI Image Generation Tool
This guide will take you through how to use Leonardo's AI Image Generation Tool

Part 1: Generating An Image
To generate an image using Leonardo, follow these steps:

Click on the ‚ÄòAI Image Generation‚Äô button from the sidebar on the left

Enter a prompt in the text box, then click on the ‚ÄúGenerate Image‚Äù button.

Wait for the tool to generate an image based on the default settings and parameters.

Once the image is generated, you can view it in the image generation feed. By hovering, you are presented with options to download, unzoom, remove background, upscale, use for image to image, edit in canvas and delete the image.

Part 2: Adjusting Settings and Parameters
Our tool allows you to adjust various settings and parameters to generate images that match your preferences. Here's how you can do it:

Open the AI Image Generation tool and navigate to the sidebar on the left.
Here is where, you can adjust the following parameters:

Number of Images: Here you can select the number of images you want to generate
Image Dimensions: Here you can adjust the size and aspect ratio of images you generate.
Guidance Scale: This allows you to set how strongly your prompt is weighted - we recommend using a value around 7
Step Count: This allows you to pick the number of steps used to generate your image. A higher step count results in longer generation times.
Tiling: Turning this toggle on will result in generations being tileable which is ideal for textures and backgrounds.
Once you have adjusted the settings and parameters, click on the "Generate Image" button to generate a new image.

Part 3: Additional Features
Our tool comes with several additional features that can enhance your image generation experience. Here's how you can use them:

Image2Image
The Image2Image feature allows you to generate an image based on another image. Here's how to use it:

Open the AI Image Generation tool and scroll down on the left-hand side. The image2image button should already be selected.
You can either drag and drop the source image you want to use, click the upload box and upload the image or hover over a previously generated image and select ‚ÄòUse for image to image‚Äô.

Set the Init Strength - a lower number results in more creativity by the model and a higher number retains more of the original image
Enter a prompt and hit generate!
Unzooming
The Unzooming feature allows you to extend or zoom out of a generated image. Here's how to use it:

After an image has been generated, hover over the image you want to unzoom and click on the unzoom icon

Wait for the tool to generate the final image, and once done, click on the image to view

From the modal you can select which variation of the image you want to view
Upscaling
The Upscaling feature allows you to increase the resolution of a low-resolution image. Here's how to use it:

After an image has been generated, hover over the image you want to upscale and click on the upscale icon
Wait for the tool to upscale the image to a higher resolution and once done, click on the image to view

From the modal you can select which variation of the image you want to view

Moving Images to the Canvas
The Moving Images to the Canvas feature allows you to move an image to a specific location on the canvas. Here's how to use it:

After an image has been generated, hover over the image you want to edit on the canvas and click on the ‚ÄòEdit In Canvas‚Äô button
This will redirect you to the AI Canvas Editor and import the image which you can then edit from there. For more information on using the canvas tool, feel free to check out the separate guide.
Prompt Generation Feature
Our prompt generation feature allows you to generate a prompt to help you come up with ideas for images. Here's how to use it:

While in the AI Image Generation Tool, click on the "Prompt Generation" heading.
Select the number of prompt you want to generate

Enter a basic concept for a prompt you want to ideate on and then click ‚ÄòIdeate‚Äô

Once the prompts are generated, you can generate directly from here by clicking on ‚ÄòGenerate‚Äô to the right of the prompt.
A Guide to Getting the Most out of Leonardo.Ai
If you‚Äôve made your way here, you‚Äôre probably looking forward to creating your own finetuned AI model

Leonardo.Ai makes it easy to get your own model going, and start generating anything you wish.

But even then, training can be a bit tricky for a first time.

So we made this guide to offer some useful tips though to make sure your model does well, and make stuff like this!

Part 1: The Basics
First thing you‚Äôll want to do is navigate over to the model training page, which can be found here.

And then go ahead and click üëâCreate New Datasetüëà
From there, it will ask you to add a name and description for your dataset.

This will not affect the model quality, but its good to give it a name to help organize when you start building more datasets

A dataset is not the model, but just a collection of images you‚Äôll feed to the machine to help it learn the style and content you want.
It‚Äôll then take you to the ‚ÄúEdit Dataset‚Äù tab where you can then upload your images.

Need some inspiration? If you scroll down a bit, we have a gallery of images you can add to your dataset.

Simply clicking on an image will add it to your dataset
Here, I now have the first 5 images of my dataset

You can remove images from your dataset by clicking on any images you‚Äôd like to remove, and then clicking the ‚ÄúRemove Images‚Äù button

This can come in handy! A good dataset is often quality over quantity.

When adjusting a dataset after a training run to give it another try, it is sometimes useful to remove certain images that may not fit well with the rest of the dataset
*You can also delete the entire dataset if you no longer need it.

Part 2: What makes a good training run
Now that we got all the basics of getting things set up, we can get to training our model

Number of Images
For this run, I‚Äôll be using 14 images

A good sweet spot is around 8-15 images. But feel free to experiment with beyond that range!

Although I do not advise going below 5 images. And it isn‚Äôt necessary to go any higher than 30 really, and can potentially hurt quality

Suggested

ideal: 8-15 images

min: 5 images

max: 30 images

This number also depends on what you‚Äôre training on. In general, training an object does not require as many images training a style seems to require more images

Dataset Characteristics
Variation vs Consistency

Consistency

It is important that there is a common theme or pattern between your images for the model to learn from

While there‚Äôs tons of different things that work, the dataset I used is a good example because all of the images share a certain camera angle and graphic style

The elements that are consistent between images are what the model learns, and will generally show up in all of the outputs.

But on that same note, it is also a good idea to have a good amount of variation between the images. Otherwise the model can ‚Äúoverfit‚Äù and get stuck on certain things that maybe we don‚Äôt want in our outputs and not listen so well to our prompts

Variation Things that vary across your images will be more loosely learned, this is what allows your model to put your trained object (the consistent elements) in new kinds of styles and contexts

There‚Äôs no perfect answer to the optimal balance between Variation and Consistency and it‚Äôs something to experiment with!

But here is an example to better illustrate what I mean

For example, if I wanted to train a model on cute animal characters,

The character position, style and image composition would be the consistent element I want it to learn
But I would want to vary the animal characters generated and the clothes they‚Äôre wearing
So ideally, each image would show various animals in different clothes in the same position with a similar image composition (i.e. full body, front facing, on a plain background)
For training a character model‚Ä¶


Back to my original dataset, this would be our bad example, all we have is an orange house now So it will very likely only be able to output orange houses‚Ä¶

Quality The age old saying is ‚ÄúGarbage in, garbage out‚Äù so it is also a good idea to use high quality images.

Instance Prompt
Nothing too complicated here, just use 2-4 words to describe your images

so for my use case: ‚Äúmedieval building‚Äù or ‚Äúa structure"

if you can‚Äôt think of any more than 1 word to describe your images, its all good! Just put ‚Äúa‚Äù right before the word‚Äù

if you got it just say "yes I got it"
```
