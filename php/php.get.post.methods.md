# PHP - GET & POST Methods

There are two ways the browser client can send information to the web server.

- The GET Method
- The POST Method

Before the browser sends the information, it encodes it using a scheme called URL encoding. In this scheme, name/value pairs are joined with equal signs and different pairs are separated by the ampersand.

```php
name1=value1&name2=value2&name3=value3
```

Spaces are removed and replaced with the + character and any other nonalphanumeric characters are replaced with a hexadecimal values. After the information is encoded it is sent to the server.

## The GET Method

The GET method sends the encoded user information appended to the page request. The page and the encoded information are separated by the ? character.

```php
http://www.test.com/index.htm?name1=value1&name2=value2
```

-The GET method produces a long string that appears in your server logs, in the browser's Location: box.

-The GET method is restricted to send upto 1024 characters only.

-Never use GET method if you have password or other sensitive information to be sent to the server.

-GET can't be used to send binary data, like images or word documents, to the server.

-The data sent by GET method can be accessed using QUERY_STRING environment variable.

-The PHP provides $\_GET associative array to access all the sent information using GET method.

### Example

```php
<?php
   if( $_GET["name"] || $_GET["age"] ) {
      echo "Welcome ". $_GET['name']. "<br />";
      echo "You are ". $_GET['age']. " years old.";

      exit();
   }
?>
<html>
   <body>

      <form action = "<?php $_PHP_SELF ?>" method = "GET">
         Name: <input type = "text" name = "name" />
         Age: <input type = "text" name = "age" />
         <input type = "submit" />
      </form>

   </body>
</html>
```

## The POST Method

The POST method transfers information via HTTP headers. The information is encoded as described in case of GET method and put into a header called QUERY_STRING.

- The POST method does not have any restriction on data size to be sent.

- The POST method can be used to send ASCII as well as binary data.

- The data sent by POST method goes through HTTP header so security depends on HTTP protocol. By using Secure HTTP you can make sure that your information is secure.

- The PHP provides $\_POST associative array to access all the sent information using POST method.

### Example

```php
<?php
   if( $_POST["name"] || $_POST["age"] ) {
      if (preg_match("/[^A-Za-z'-]/",$_POST['name'] )) {
         die ("invalid name and name should be alpha");
      }
      echo "Welcome ". $_POST['name']. "<br />";
      echo "You are ". $_POST['age']. " years old.";

      exit();
   }
?>
<html>
   <body>

      <form action = "<?php $_PHP_SELF ?>" method = "POST">
         Name: <input type = "text" name = "name" />
         Age: <input type = "text" name = "age" />
         <input type = "submit" />
      </form>

   </body>
</html>
```

## The $\_REQUEST variable

The PHP $\_REQUEST variable contains the contents of both $\_GET, $\_POST, and $\_COOKIE.
The PHP $\_REQUEST variable can be used to get the result from form data sent with both the GET and POST methods.

### Example

```php
<?php
   if( $_REQUEST["name"] || $_REQUEST["age"] ) {
      echo "Welcome ". $_REQUEST['name']. "<br />";
      echo "You are ". $_REQUEST['age']. " years old.";
      exit();
   }
?>
<html>
   <body>

      <form action = "<?php $_PHP_SELF ?>" method = "POST">
         Name: <input type = "text" name = "name" />
         Age: <input type = "text" name = "age" />
         <input type = "submit" />
      </form>

   </body>
</html>
```
