# JSON Tools for Every Developer

## Introduction

> **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition â€” December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.

Below are five JSON tools frequently used in daily software development work.

## 1. Boop GTK

After several years using various online tools for JSON formatting, this offline tool was discovered through [Bennett Garner's story](https://blog.developerpurpose.com/6-free-tools-i-use-to-increase-my-coding-productivity-8831bb573cee) about his coding productivity tools. Previously, [this JSON formatter and validator](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/) was in use before Boop GTK.

A free and open-source application for developers.

## 2. JSON Diff

An online tool for side-by-side comparison of two JSON objects. Objects can be directly placed inside the left and right editors, or specific JSON files can be attached.

[JSON Diff](https://jsondiff.com/?source=post_page-----70a4c939338c--------------------------------)

Validate, format, and compare two JSON documents. See the differences between the objects instead of just the new lines.

## 3. JSON Crack Editor

This editor can display JSON data as a graph. The first (root) level shows basic data types such as strings, numbers, and booleans. It allows collapsing and expanding additional parts of the JSON array. Inner objects inside the JSON appear as links from the first (root) level.

Visualizing into graphs, analyzing, editing, formatting, querying, and transforming JSON data.

## 4. JSON Sorter

As the name suggests, this tool sorts keys inside the JSON content. Similar to the JSON diff tool, JSON files can be attached. A generic example of the JSON content can be added, and the JSON can be cleared from the editor with a single click.

Sort JSON keys and values, rearrange JSON text alphabetically and numerically.

## 5. JSON URL Encoder

This tool is handy when adding URL query parameter values as JSON. The left side contains the JSON data format, which gets converted to URL encoded JSON on the right side.

[URL-encode JSON - Online JSON Tools](https://onlinejsontools.com/url-encode-json?source=post_page-----70a4c939338c--------------------------------)

Simple, free, and easy-to-use tool for URL-encoding JSON without ads or popups.

## Conclusion

JSON data format is used daily by developers worldwide. Proficiency with available JSON tools can significantly enhance productivity.
