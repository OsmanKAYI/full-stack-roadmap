## 1. Avoid Using Sliders

Sliders fail to engage users effectively, as most stop at the first or second slide. They can also slow down your site.

**Tip**: Use clear, static visuals for better communication.

## 2. Simplify Navigation

Hidden or dropdown menus add unnecessary steps. Display navigation prominently for easy access.

**Tip**: Fit menus within one screen whenever possible.

## 3. Stop Center-Aligning Text

Center-aligned text disrupts readability, especially for longer content.

**Tip**: Left-align text for a cleaner reading experience.

## 4. Avoid Justified Text

Justified text creates inconsistent spacing, impacting readability on various screens.

**Tip**: Stick to left-aligned text for smoother flow.

## 5. Skip Splash Pages

Splash pages delay content access and frustrate users.

**Tip**: Direct users to main content immediately.

## 6. Avoid Slow Animations

Slow-loading animations can irritate users seeking quick information.

**Tip**: Keep animations fast and minimal.

## 7. Keep the Scroll Bar Visible

Hiding the scroll bar disrupts navigation familiarity.

**Tip**: Let it remain visible for seamless browsing.

## 8. Use Consistent Background Colors

Changing background colors during scrolling distracts users.

**Tip**: Opt for a cohesive, consistent design.

## 9. Avoid Click-Only Dropdowns

Dropdown menus should open on hover for smoother navigation.

**Tip**: Align with user expectations to improve usability.

## 10. Limit Emoji Usage

Excessive emojis can appear unprofessional.

**Tip**: Use clean, brand-aligned visuals instead.

## 11. Skip Lengthy Opening Messages

Time-consuming intros deter users from engaging with content.

**Tip**: Be concise and direct.

## 12. Stick to Standard Hamburger Icons

Unconventional designs confuse users.

**Tip**: Use universally recognized icons for navigation.

## 13. Avoid Horizontal Submenus

Horizontal layouts disrupt user habits.

**Tip**: Use vertical submenus for better navigation flow.

## 14. Highlight Call-to-Action (CTA)

CTAs blending with the design go unnoticed.

**Tip**: Use bold, contrasting colors to make CTAs stand out.

## 15. Add Backgrounds to Sticky Menus

Transparent sticky menus can confuse users.

**Tip**: Use a background color for clarity.

## 16. Use Arrow Icons for Submenus

Arrows clearly indicate submenu presence.

**Tip**: Enhance navigation with simple visual cues.

## 17. Combine First and Last Name Fields

Separate fields unnecessarily complicate forms.

**Tip**: Use a single "Full Name" field for convenience.

## 18. Donâ€™t Skip Form Labels

Placeholders alone are insufficient.

**Tip**: Include visible labels for clarity.

## 19. Include Your Company Name in Logos

Logos without names can confuse visitors.

**Tip**: Pair your logo with your company name for recognition.

## 20. Avoid Hard-to-Click Elements

Small buttons or links frustrate users.

**Tip**: Design large, tappable elements.

## 21. Test for Accessibility

Overlooked accessibility features can alienate users.

**Tip**: Ensure compatibility with screen readers, proper contrast, and keyboard navigation.
