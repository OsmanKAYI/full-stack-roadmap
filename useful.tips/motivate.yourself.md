# How to Be Motivated to Study?

One of the most challenging tasks while balancing office work and studies is to **stay focused on your goal without distractions**.

It's tough to persist when you're in an environment where higher studies don't seem important to others, where people are enjoying life, getting married, pursuing new opportunities, or switching jobs for better pay. Meanwhile, you might feel alone, fighting for an uncertain goal, sometimes feeling devastated as you watch others settle into their lives while you’re still struggling to achieve something meaningful.

**The Lesson**  
Think about your goal and be patient because what you are carrying is mighty and great. Keep faith in yourself. Don't focus on success or failure—those are not entirely in our control. Instead, focus on making your journey beautiful and memorable.
