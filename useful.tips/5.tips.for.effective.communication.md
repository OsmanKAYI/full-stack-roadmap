# 5 Tips for Effective Communication

🛑 Don’ts & ✅ Do’s for Effective Remote Communication

Daily written communication is as essential as the code produced.

The clarity of written messages can significantly influence efficiency: a colleague might take either 1 minute or 10 minutes to interpret a message. If this occurs multiple times each day, clearer writing could save the company considerable time.

## Use Shorter Sentences for More Effective Communication

Short sentences convey information more powerfully and are easier to comprehend than longer ones.

🛑 **Don’t:** _The API, which was developed using Python and includes multiple validation layers and error-checking mechanisms, processes the user input after ensuring all required fields are present and correctly formatted according to the specification._

✅ **Do:** _The API validates user input before processing the request._

### **Tip 1: Focus Each Sentence on a Single Idea**

Just as a single line of code executes a specific task, each sentence should express one idea.

🛑 **Don’t:** _The authentication system handles user login requests by first validating the provided credentials against the database, then generating a secure JWT token if validation succeeds, and finally returning the token to the client which can be used for subsequent API calls until it expires after 24 hours._

✅ **Do:** _The authentication system manages user login requests. First, it validates the provided credentials against the database. If validation is successful, the system generates a secure JWT token. The token is then returned to the client and can be used for subsequent API calls, expiring after 24 hours._

### **Tip 2: Eliminate Filler Words for More Direct and Effective Writing**

Many sentences include filler words that add little value. Removing these words enhances clarity and impact.

🛑 **Don’t:** _It should be noted that in order to properly save any changes that have been made, it is necessary for the user to proceed to click on the submit button._

✅ **Do:** _Click the submit button to save changes._

With practice, recognizing filler words becomes easier. Here’s another example:

🛑 **Don’t:** _The logging system performs the monitoring of application errors._

✅ **Do:** _The logging system monitors application errors._

The table below provides concise alternatives to common filler words.

### **Tip 3: Subordinate Clauses Should Support, Not Distract from, the Main Sentence Idea**

Every sentence consists of:

- A main clause
- Zero or more subordinate clauses

Subordinate clauses should enhance the main clause’s idea rather than introduce unrelated information. Common words that introduce subordinate clauses include _which, that, because, whose, until, unless,_ and _since._

The goal is to use subordinate clauses that support the main idea without diverting into a separate concept.

Consider these examples where subordinate clauses distract from the main idea, along with improved versions:

🛑 **Don’t:** _Docker containers provide application isolation, which was first released as an open-source project in 2013 and has revolutionized deployment practices._

✅ **Revised:** _Docker containers provide application isolation. They were first released as an open-source project in 2013 and have revolutionized deployment practices._

🛑 **Don’t:** _Git helps track code changes effectively, which requires developers to learn specific commands that can be complex for beginners who are transitioning from other version control systems._

✅ **Revised:** _Git effectively tracks code changes. It requires developers to learn specific commands that can be complex for beginners transitioning from other version control systems._

In the following examples, the subordinate clauses **support** the main idea, so they can remain:

✅ **Do:** _Developers should use environment variables that contain sensitive configuration data._

✅ **Do:** _She didn’t attend the meeting because she had a prior commitment._

Now, analyze another example and identify the subordinate clauses to determine if they should be removed:

❓**Example:** _The project deadline has been extended, which will allow more time for testing, because some team members were out sick._

#### **Technical Folks Love Lists: Use Them Correctly!**

There are three main types of lists:

- **Numbered lists:** Use these when items are ordered, and rearranging them would change the meaning.
- **Bulleted lists:** Use these when items are not ordered, so rearranging them won’t alter the meaning.
- **Embedded lists:** Avoid these in technical information, as they contain items within a sentence and can be difficult to read.

### **Tip 4: Convert Long Sentences into Lists**

Often, lengthy technical sentences can be transformed into lists for improved readability.

🛑 **Don’t:** _To log in, users must enter their username and password, followed by a two-factor authentication code that will be sent to their registered device, which they must then input within 60 seconds._

✅ **Do:** _The login process requires:_

- _Username_
- _Password_
- _Two-factor authentication code_

When encountering an “or” conjunction in a long sentence, break it down into a list.

🛑 **Don’t:** _To secure your AWS account, you can enable multi-factor authentication, implement IP-based restrictions, rotate access keys regularly, or set up CloudWatch alerts for suspicious activities._

✅ **Do:** _To secure your AWS account, you can:_

- _Enable multi-factor authentication_
- _Implement IP-based restrictions_
- _Rotate access keys regularly_
- _Set up CloudWatch alerts for suspicious activities_

### **Tip 5: Keep Lists Parallel**

Effective lists are parallel; non-parallel lists tend to feel disjointed. In a parallel list, all items should match along these parameters:

- Grammar
- Logical category
- Capitalization
- Punctuation

Here’s an example of a non-parallel list where the second item uses a full sentence, while the others are short phrases:

🛑 **Don’t:**

- _Lightweight design_
- _The device can last up to 12 hours on a single charge_
- _Comes in multiple colors_

In contrast, the following list is parallel:

✅ **Do:**

- _Lightweight design_
- _Long-lasting battery_
- _Multiple color options_

The following list is non-parallel because the second item is in passive voice:

🛑 **Don’t:**

- _Label all drawers._
- _Supplies should be sorted by type._
- _Place bins in accessible locations._

✅ **Do:**

- _Label all drawers._
- _Sort supplies by type._
- _Place bins in accessible locations._

The next list is non-parallel because the second item doesn’t start with an imperative verb:

🛑 **Don’t:**

- _Exercise daily._
- _A balanced diet._
- _Get enough sleep._

✅ **Do:**

- _Exercise daily._
- _Eat a balanced diet._
- _Get enough sleep._
